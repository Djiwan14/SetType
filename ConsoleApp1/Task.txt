Implement the types using classes. Represent the types using sequences of same-type
elements (List<> in C#).

Create a main program with a menu to demonstrate the services (all the methods) a class
provides in arbitrary order (based on the selections of the user). 

Make the main program instantiate an object of the class. 

The methods of the class can be called through the menu items. 

Print the state of the object either after the completion of each menu item or through another menu item for printing. 

If there are methods or friend functions that need multiple
objects (like adding two matrices, for example), the main program should make it possible to create and print these objects through the menu.
Implement unit tests which should be run automatically.7th task            Implement the set type which contains integers. Represent the set as a sequence of its
            elements.Implement as methods: inserting an element, removing an element, returning
            whether the set is empty, returning whether the set contains an element, returning a
            random element without removing it from the set, returning the sum of the numbers in
            the set(suggestion: store the sum and update it when the set changes), printing the set.    
            A set can store every element only once
